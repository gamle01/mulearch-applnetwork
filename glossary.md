# Glossary of Terms

## API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other.

## REST API (Representational State Transfer API)
A type of API that adheres to the principles of REST, an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and is stateless, meaning each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.

## HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
The protocol used for transmitting web pages over the Internet. HTTP defines methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., which REST APIs utilize.

## Endpoint
A specific URL at which an API can be accessed by a client application. Each endpoint represents a specific function or resource within an API.

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Commonly used in REST APIs to format data.

## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Sometimes used in APIs for data representation.

## CRUD Operations
An acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage and are often mapped to HTTP methods in REST APIs (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).

## Authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a user or application. Common methods include API keys, OAuth, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## OAuth
An open standard for access delegation commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords.

## Rate Limiting
A mechanism used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network. It is used in APIs to limit the number of API calls a client can make within a certain time period.

## API Gateway
A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then passing the response back to the requester.

## Middleware
Software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. Middleware can facilitate communication and data management for APIs.

## Integration
The process of linking together different computing systems and software applications physically or functionally to act as a coordinated whole.

## ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)
A middleware tool that distributes work among connected components of an application. It helps in integrating different applications by providing a communication layer between them.

## Mulesoft
A software company that provides integration software for connecting applications, data, and devices. Mulesoft's Anypoint Platform is a widely used integration platform for building application networks.

## Anypoint Platform
Mulesoftâ€™s flagship product that provides a unified solution for API design and development, lifecycle management, and integration. It includes tools for API creation, management, and monitoring.

## Mule Runtime Engine
The core of the Anypoint Platform, it enables developers to connect applications easily and quickly. Mule Runtime Engine is responsible for running Mule applications and handling the communication between systems.

## Flow
In Mulesoft, a flow is a sequence of processing steps that are triggered by an event, such as receiving an HTTP request or reading a message from a queue.

## Connector
A reusable component in Mulesoft that allows an application to interact with a specific protocol or API. Connectors simplify integration by providing pre-built, configurable building blocks.

## DataWeave
A powerful data transformation language used in Mulesoft for transforming data between different formats (e.g., JSON to XML, XML to CSV).

## API Manager
A component of the Anypoint Platform that allows users to manage APIs, including setting policies, monitoring usage, and securing access.

## RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language)
A YAML-based language for describing RESTful APIs. RAML provides a structured way to describe your API, including endpoints, request/response types, and other details.

## SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
A protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. SOAP uses XML for message format and relies on application layer protocols, typically HTTP or SMTP, for message negotiation and transmission.

## Web Service
A service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Web. Web services typically use APIs to provide functionality over the internet.

## SLA (Service Level Agreement)
A formal contract between a service provider and a client that specifies the performance standards the provider is obligated to meet, such as uptime and response time for APIs.

## Throttling
The process of limiting the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specified time frame. Throttling helps in managing traffic and protecting the API from being overwhelmed.

## Microservices
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of software tools and libraries that developers can use to create applications for specific platforms. SDKs often include API documentation, code samples, and other resources to help developers integrate with a platform.
